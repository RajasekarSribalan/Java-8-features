# Java-8-features

Some of the most interesting new features in Java 8 are,


**Interface**

   * [Static methods](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/1_Interface_features.md)
   * [Default methods](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/1_Interface_features.md)
   
**Method References** 
	Method reference can be used as a shorter and more readable alternative for a lambda expression which only calls an existing method. There are four variants of method references. It can be used to refer method of functional interface.Lambda expression can be replaced with method reference.When your lambda expression is referring to another method,in this case method reference can be used.
    
   * [Reference to a Static Method](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/Method%20reference/Reference%20to%20a%20Static%20Method.md)
   * [Reference to an Instance Method](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/Method%20reference/Reference%20to%20a%20Instance%20Method.md)
   * [Reference to an Instance Method of an Object of a Particular Type](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/Method%20reference/Reference%20to%20an%20Instance%20Method%20of%20an%20Object%20of%20a%20Particular%20Type.md)
   * [Reference to a Constructor](https://github.com/RajasekarSribalan/Java-8-features/blob/master/Method%20reference/Reference%20to%20a%20constructor.md)
