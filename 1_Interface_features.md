# Interface features

Before Java 8, interfaces can have only public abstract methods and no implementations can be added to the interface. It was not possible to add new functionality to the existing interface without forcing all implementing classes to create an implementation of the new methods, nor it was possible to create interface methods with an implementation.

When we need to add any new functionality to interface,then all the implementaion classes will undergo changes.

Starting with Java 8, interfaces can have static and default methods that, despite being declared in an interface, have a defined behavior.
